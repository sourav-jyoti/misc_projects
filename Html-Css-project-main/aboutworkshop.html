            The Planetarium has upgraded the earlier installed 2D Projection System to a more sophisticated and state-of-the-art 3D Projection System which will give user a visually enhanced and immersive experience. The Planetarium will re-open for public from 1st April, 2023 from 2:00 PM onwards on the same day with increased number of shows and enhanced graphical performance.

The Nehru Planetarium in New Delhi is situated in the green surroundings of the Teen Murti House, earlier the official residence of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru and now a museum in his memory. Conscious of the fact that an understanding of the spirit and method of science was crucial for children to become responsible citizens, Nehru liked every opportunity to be provided to them in this endeavor. In 1964, the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund was set up to promote his ideas and subsequently it undertook to build the Nehru Planetarium with its primary aim being the promotion of astronomy education. Nehru Planetarium is now a wing of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, an autonomous body under Ministry of Culture, Government of India.
